# Pandas-Challenge (PyCityChools Analysis)

## Purpose
To analyze the school districts' data in relation to school's budgets and standardized test scores. Based on data and records of schools performance, I will list trends that can assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding the future shool budgets and priorities.

## Description
The **_[PyCityCode.ipynb](https://github.com/WayneJ2/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCityCode.ipynb
)_** file includes the code as well as the developed tables that show various correlations listed in the _Table of Figures_ below.


## Table of Figures

1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Top Performing Schools
4. Bottom Performing Schools
5. Math Scores By Grade
6. Reading Scores By Grade
7. Scores By School Spending
8. Scores By School Size
9. Scores By School Type

## Observable Trends From Data

1. PyCity School District currently  _**averages $629 per student**_ over the 15 schools.
2. PyCity School District shows a roughly _**10% lag in students passing math**_.
3. Schools that have an _**average math score >80 in addition to a >80 reading score**_ tend to have a _**better overall passing percentage**_.
4. Data shows an _**inverse correlation between math scores vs Per Student Spending and School Size**_, showing a _**20% drop**_ in passing math scores for _**schools > 2000 students or spending > $630 per student**_.
5. While the 5 best overall passing schools show to be Charter Schools, the _**5 lowest overall passing schools are District Schools**_ due to _**math scores lagging by 30%**_ to there counterparts with _**these schools having >2000+ students and spending >$630 per student**_.
